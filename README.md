# WeatherAPP - Swift iOS

This is a simple weather app UI for iOS. It was built using **SwiftUI** as a learning project. The app shows hardcoded weather data. It has different views for day and night modes.

## Features

- 🌤 **Day/Night Mode**: The background changes based on the time of day.
- 📅 **5-Day Forecast**: Shows weather for the next 5 days.
- 🎨 **Dynamic Background**: Beautiful gradient backgrounds for day and night.
- 📱 **Simple and Responsive UI**: Works well on all screen sizes.

## What I Learned

- **SwiftUI**: Building UIs without using storyboards.
- **State and Binding**: Managing data flow between views.
- **Custom Views**: Breaking UI into small, reusable components.
- **Day/Night Mode**: Changing the background based on time.

## Next Steps

- Connect to a real weather API.
- Add user input for location.
- Improve the UI.
